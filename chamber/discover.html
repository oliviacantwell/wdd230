            <p class = 'disc-text'>Frisco Texas is known for its dedication to football, rapid growth, and successful economic structure. It has had a recent movement of modern and low-tax development 
            to invite others to join its large city. While there is an impressive moving rate, only 10% of the residents actually move outside of the city. It has one of the greatest 
            population retension rates in North Texas area.

            <p class = 'disc-text'>Frisco was not always the glamerous city it is today. It started off as a small railroad and mining town. Back in 1956 govenor 
            John Williams issued a publication about the benefits of living in Frisco. He sent the article to New York and to be published in 
            the "New York Times". After readers all over the world sae his passionate article, Frisco saw a mass influx of over 50,000 new 
            residents in the next two years.

            <img class = 'discover-image' src="https://placeholder.com/300" data-src="images/Optimized-growing.jpg" alt = 'Statistical chart showing top 15 highest growing cities'>
            <p class = 'disc-text'>Since then Frisco has greatly increased in population and economic growth. According to <a href= 'https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunityimpact.com%2Fdallas-fort-worth%2Ffrisco%2Fpeople%2F2020%2F05%2F21%2Ffrisco-crosses-200k-population-tops-list-of-fastest-growing-large-us-cities%2F&psig=AOvVaw3a93LBdRpRRih8BLdlHZ-Z&ust=1648852728602000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAwQjhxqFwoTCPj7-5y18fYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD'>Community Impact</a>
            Frisco was one of the top 15 fastest growing cities in the US in 2019. In 2023 it is estimated to have quadroupled its growth. 
            Some still attribute its success to the article by Williams.</p>

            <img class = 'discover-image' src="https://placeholder.com/300" data-src="images/Optimized-railroad museum.png" alt="The logo for the American Train Museum">
            <p class = 'disc-text'>Because Frisco started as a simple railroad town, trains are a heavily themed aesthetic in the city and schools. Statues of trains litter the streets
            and they even have a yearly train modeling competition! Located in Frisco is the American History Museum of trains. The owner and head manager, Bob Bobbly, 
            has been a train enthusiast for over 95 years.</p>

            <img class = 'discover-image' src="https://placeholder.com/300" data-src="images/Optimized-high school football.jpg" alt = 'Frisco high school football team'>
            <p class = 'disc-text'>Of course since we are in the southern state of Texas, football is considered a religion in Frisco. The local high school has one of the largest football teams 
            in the south! They had the privilege of playing a game against Mike Tyson in 2020 for the national golden cup series. While they did not win first, they came
            in as a close 14th.</p>

            <p class = 'disc-text'>It is not just the local high schoolers that have an intense love of football, but the adults do as well! The Dallas Cowboys team decided to build the Ford Center for practices 
            and smaller games right in the heart of Frisco. Local high schools and dad clubs can reserve practices and games when it is not booked by the Cowboys team.</p>

            <img class = 'discover-image' src="https://placeholder.com/300" data-src="images/Optimized-ballpark-frisco.jpg" alt="The front of the Dr Pepper Ballpark stadium">
            <p class = 'disc-text'>Frisco residents are Dr Pepper addicts. They love is so much that the chamber of commerce funded the 4 billion dollar ballpark stadium to represent their admiration towards
            this sugary drink. Tickets to attend a game here have a 5 year wait list. This may be due to the fact that anyone who gets a ticket and attends the game can get an unlimited
            month supply of Dr Pepper. Those who have gotten such a supply have promptly been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, but this does not stop their soda worship.</p>

            <p class = 'disc-text'>Since everything is bigger in Texas, their Christmas celebrations are too! Downtown Frisco has over 1000 watts of power in this Christmas light bulbs. Every year the day after Thanksgiving,
            the town gathers for a celebration to turn on the lights for the first time. There is singing, dancing, and Dr Pepper. </p>

            <img class = 'discover-image' src="https://placeholder.com/300" data-src="images/Optimized-stonebriar.jpg" alt="The front of StoneBriar mall at night">
            <p class = 'disc-text'>For the few residents who have been ostrisized for their dislike of football, there are other options of local activities. The Frisco Stonebriar mall has over 34 stores and mini resturaunts. 
            Unlike other malls, Stonebriar has a 5 year rotation method. After 5 years, the stores have to move out and give their spot to another local business. This helps other small businesses
            have the opportunity for growth and to be introduced to the public.
