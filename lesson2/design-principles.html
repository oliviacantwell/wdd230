            <p class = "box-text">The UPS Store website has a repeating word theme. They wanted to demonstrate the services they offer
                by having an "ing" theme. They offer "printing", "shipping", "notorizing", and more "ing"s. This 
                can been seen throughout their page.

            <p class = "box-text">The McDonalds website tries to offer simplicity. It follows Hick's law by attempting to not overwhelm
                the user with too many options. Notice how on the screen there are only two options. You can scroll down 
                further to see another option, but the whole homepage only has a small handful of options or buttons to click on.

            <p class = "box-text">The Doordash home page does a great job at maintaining organization through alignment. Noticed how it displays a grid of 
                the options to choose from. They are all neatly aligned with one another to make it easier for the users eyes to navigate.
